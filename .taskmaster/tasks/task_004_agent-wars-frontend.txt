# Task ID: 4
# Title: Page: Landing Page with 3D visuals and interactive node graph
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the marketing/overview page with a blue futuristic theme, lightweight 3D scene (React Three Fiber + Three.js), and an interactive node graph (react-force-graph) illustrating system capabilities. Emphasize performance and lazy loading.
# Details:
Implementation subtasks (target 5):
1) Implement 3D + node graph UI
- Next.js App Router page at / with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui. Dynamic import of 3D canvas and graph to avoid SSR.
- 3D: @react-three/fiber v9 + @react-three/drei helpers. Minimal scene: animated glTF nodes or primitives with bloom/postprocessing kept off for perf, orbit controls disabled on mobile.
- Graph: react-force-graph (2D) with ~20 nodes representing features; hover tooltips; click to navigate to Hub/Scale/PromptBro.
- Theme: Tailwind + CSS variables for blues; backdrop-blur panels; gradient text.
- Accessibility: prefers-reduced-motion disables heavy animations.

2) Perf and UX polish
- Lazy load components with suspense fallbacks; use requestAnimationFrame throttling; useResizeObserver to tune dpr; Lighthouse budget.

3) Cleanup
- Remove unused shaders/assets; compress textures; ensure components are client-only where needed ("use client").

4) Quality Gate (run tests/lint)
- Playwright smoke test: page loads, FPS above threshold via Performance API, nav via graph clicks works.
- ESLint/TypeScript clean.

5) Context7 MCP research for external packages/libraries used
- React Three Fiber/drei latest docs; react-force-graph rendering performance tips; Next.js dynamic import patterns for client-only libs.

Pseudo-code (client components):
function Scene(){ /* Canvas, ambientLight, rotating meshes */ }
function CapabilitiesGraph(){ /* ForceGraph2D with nodes/links, onNodeClick router.push */ }

Research-backed enhancements:
- R3F performance
  - Load Canvas and any Three-only code via next/dynamic (ssr:false) to keep it client-only.
  - Default Canvas frameloop='demand'; switch to 'always' only during user interaction; on prefers-reduced-motion or when tab is hidden, use frameloop='never'.
  - Use drei AdaptiveDpr and PerformanceMonitor to auto-tune quality; clamp DPR to min 1 and max 1.5 on typical devices (up to 1.75 on high-end). Drive clamp via ResizeObserver and simple heuristics (e.g., performance memory if available).
  - Keep scene minimal: no shadows or postprocessing, simple materials, tiny glTF or primitives.
  - On mobile and/or reduced motion, do not mount the Scene; render a static optimized hero image instead.
- Graph performance
  - Use ForceGraph2D with warmupTicks and cooldownTicks (e.g., warmup 30–60, cooldown 80–120) to settle layout quickly; after first settle, freeze layout (set cooldownTicks=0 or stopAnimation) and increase d3VelocityDecay.
  - Implement nodeCanvasObject for custom node + label rendering; precompute/cache label text widths to avoid repeated measureText calls.
  - Use nodePointerAreaPaint to enlarge pointer hit areas for small nodes to improve hover/click accuracy without visual changes.
  - Render tooltip as an overlay HTML element positioned on pointermove, throttled via requestAnimationFrame; avoid triggering canvas rerenders for tooltip updates.
  - Clamp renderer pixelRatio to ~1–1.5 for large/high-DPR cases; limit linkDirectionalParticles and other animations for stability.
- UX and loading
  - Lazy-load heavy assets/components behind Suspense with lightweight skeletons; set prefetch=off for 3D/graph chunks; preconnect to any external asset/CDN origins.
  - Compress models/textures (KTX2/Draco for glTF; WebP/AVIF for images) and inline tiny assets; disable OrbitControls on mobile and node dragging on touch devices.
- CI and quality gates
  - Lighthouse budget remains enforced; extend Playwright FPS sanity using Performance API to assert idle FPS >= 45 and that DPR clamping is active (read devicePixelRatio).
  - Axe-core checks include tooltip contrast and reduced-motion compliance.
  - Add a Playwright case toggling prefers-reduced-motion to assert static fallback is rendered and 3D is not mounted.
- References to include in /docs/landing-3d-graph.md
  - @react-three/fiber v9 best practices (frameloop, suspense), drei AdaptiveDpr and PerformanceMonitor usage.
  - react-force-graph optimization tips (nodeCanvasObject, nodePointerAreaPaint, warmup/cooldown, pixelRatio).
  - Next.js dynamic import patterns for client-only libraries.

Tooling baseline and Makefile (per PRD “Local Tooling Stack”):
- Add dev deps: eslint, eslint-config-next, eslint-config-prettier, prettier, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, playwright, @axe-core/playwright, lighthouse-ci.
- Config files: .eslintrc.(js|cjs), .eslintignore, .prettierrc, .prettierignore, vitest.config.ts (jsdom for any DOM utils), playwright.config.ts (project: landing, headless by default), .lighthouserc.json pointing to lighthouse-budget.json.
- Introduce Makefile targets used locally and in CI:
  - make install (package install)
  - make lint (eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx)
  - make format (prettier --write .)
  - make format-check (prettier --check .)
  - make unit (vitest run --coverage)
  - make e2e (playwright test)
  - make a11y (playwright test -g "a11y" using @axe-core/playwright checks)
  - make lhci (lhci autorun)
  - make check (lint + format-check + unit)
  - make ci (check + e2e + a11y + lhci; fail on any nonzero exit)
- Vitest scope for this task: add unit tests for small utilities (e.g., DPR clamp heuristic, tooltip text width cache) to ensure deterministic behavior.
- Playwright integrates axe checks (contrast, landmarks, reduced-motion compliance) alongside existing smoke; tag a11y tests to run via make a11y.
- Lighthouse CI runs with existing budget (TTI, main-thread blocking) via make lhci.
- Respect Output Policy for Prompt agents in any helper tools or examples referenced by this page: avoid live model calls in tests, mock responses, and include a brief policy note/link in /docs/landing-3d-graph.md.

Quality-Gate Loop
- a) Cleanup: remove redundant files/junk code; update .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and reports (e.g., .next, out, coverage, playwright-report, .lighthouseci, .DS_Store, logs); refresh README with setup, run, and Quality-Gate steps.
- b) Self-Review: inspect the full diff; ensure each subtask’s deliverables exist and are sensible (app/(marketing)/page.tsx, components/Scene.tsx, components/CapabilitiesGraph.tsx, theme tokens, docs/landing-3d-graph.md, Makefile/configs). Sanity-check reduced-motion behavior, DPR clamping, graph navigation, and that tests/docs reference the actual implementations.
- c) Git add & commit: stage changes and create descriptive, atomic commits per area (UI, perf, tests, docs). Do not push.

Pre-commit enforcement
- Add Makefile aliases:
  - make quality → same as make check (lint + format-check + unit).
  - make test → same as make e2e (Playwright suite).
- Add a pre-commit hook at .git/hooks/pre-commit to run: make quality && make test; ensure it is executable and blocks the commit on failure. Document this workflow in README and discourage --no-verify.

**Subtask 4.3: Cleanup: assets, compression, and client-only boundaries**  
Scope  
- Remove unused drei helpers/shaders from Scene; verify no postprocessing/shadows.  
- Ensure all R3F/graph components are client-only ("use client" + next/dynamic ssr:false) and no SSR-only APIs used.  
- Compress media assets (convert hero images to WebP/AVIF if applicable); document glTF compression plan (KTX2/Draco) for later if models exist.  
- Audit bundle: remove dead imports, code-split optional UI blocks (e.g., heavy tooltips/modals) and ensure graph chunking.  

Targets  
- components: `src/agents_wars/web/src/components/ThreeScene.tsx` (or equivalent), `src/agents_wars/web/src/components/NodeGraph.tsx`.  
- page: `src/agents_wars/web/app/page.tsx` dynamic wrappers already present; confirm Suspense fallbacks and prefetch disabled if heavy.  

Checks  
- Typecheck and lint: zero warnings.  
- Visual parity maintained; no SSR warnings at runtime.  
- Reduced-motion behavior preserved.  

Next steps  
- Implement file-level edits, run make check + e2e; prepare brief diff summary.
