# Title: Frontend: Jobs Pipeline Page Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Jobs Pipeline page, including components for header, job scheduler, queue, system resources charts, and job history, ensuring functionality with Recharts for chart placeholders.
# Details:
1. Create a new file `src/jobs/page.tsx` for the Jobs Pipeline component. 2. Implement a header that includes the title and navigation links. 3. Develop a job scheduler section that allows users to schedule jobs. 4. Create a queue section to display queued jobs. 5. Implement system resources charts using Recharts to visualize CPU, memory, and disk usage. 6. Add a job history section to display past job executions and their statuses. 7.
