# Task ID: 7
# Title: Page: PromptBro guided prompt creator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a guided prompt creation experience where users input free text and interact with a custom LLM agent that asks clarifying questions. Save resulting prompts as PromptTemplates for reuse. Leave hooks for future checks/fixes.
# Details:
Implementation subtasks (target 5):
1) Implement guided creator UI + backend
- Page /promptbro with multi-step wizard (shadcn/ui Steps/Tabs): Context, Constraints, Style, Evaluation Criteria. Live preview of assembled prompt.
- Custom LLM assistant: /api/promptbro/assist that takes current draft and returns next best question or improvement suggestion (uses provider abstraction, small model, capped tokens).
- Save as PromptTemplate via POST /api/prompts (name, template, variables). List saved templates.

2) Draft assembly + versioning
- Maintain prompt draft in state with templating variables like {{goal}} {{constraints}}. Provide export and copy.
- Version saved drafts (append timestamp) and allow restore.

3) Cleanup
- Persist last draft in localStorage. Remove experimental flags. Ensure server routes validate inputs with zod.

4) Quality Gate (run tests/lint)
- Unit: Assistant returns a question given a partial draft (mocked LLM). Template save/restore works.
- E2E: Create and save a prompt, reload page, and see it listed.

5) Context7 MCP research for external packages/libraries used
- Prompt engineering guidance for question-driven refinement; shadcn/ui patterns for wizards; content security for user text.

Pseudo-code (assist route):
POST /api/promptbro/assist ->
  const { draft } = await req.json();
  const sys = 'You help craft prompts by asking one clarifying question at a time...';
  const res = await llm.chat([{ role:'system', content: sys }, { role:'user', content: draft }], { provider, model: smallModel, maxTokens: 128 });
  return { question: res.text };

Research-backed enhancements:

- Evaluation Criteria generation and persistence
  - In the Evaluation Criteria step, add a Derive Evaluation Criteria action that POSTs to /api/promptbro/eval-criteria with the current assembled prompt and step context, returning a deterministic JSON checklist.
  - JSON shape (validated with zod) includes: checklist[] items with id, name, description, weight 0..1 (default 1), required (bool); optional scoring with method (weighted|binary|rubric) and passingThreshold 0..1.
  - Allow inline editing of the returned checklist before save. Persist this as evaluationCriteria on POST /api/prompts alongside { name, template, variables }. Include evaluationCriteria in GET list responses.

- Assist streaming over SSE (Edge)
  - Add /api/promptbro/assist/stream running on Edge runtime and emitting Server-Sent Events with a heartbeat every 15–30s. Events: message (partial tokens or final question), heartbeat, done, error.
  - Default small model gpt-4o-mini (or equivalent via OpenRouter). Enforce strict caps: maxTokens <= 256 and per-request budget <= $0.002. Perform preflight cost estimation using the provider price map; reject with 402/400 if budget would be exceeded. Keep temperature low.
  - Retain existing non-streaming /api/promptbro/assist for fallback; UI auto-selects SSE when supported and falls back on error.

- Quick checks before save (Promptfoo-style mini suite)
  - Add /api/promptbro/checks that runs a fast heuristic suite to flag: ambiguity (missing audience, success criteria, timeframe, data sources), prompt injection patterns (e.g., ignore previous, system:, jailbreak markers), output format risks (JSON shape mismatches if evaluationCriteria exists), and constraint coverage (unreferenced required tokens).
  - Returns { issues: [{ id, severity: low|medium|high, message, hint }], score: 0..100 }.
  - UI adds Run Quick Checks; on high severity, show a warning and allow override to save.

- Persistence and quotas
  - Local draft autosave remains with 500ms debounce; surface last autosave time in UI.
  - Add a configurable per-user daily cap for assist calls (fallback to per-IP when unauthenticated). Env: PROMPTBRO_ASSIST_DAILY_CAP (default 50). Enforce across both /assist and /assist/stream; return 429 when exceeded. Use Redis if available; otherwise in-memory map with TTL.

- Validation and schemas
  - Extend POST /api/prompts zod schema to accept optional evaluationCriteria JSON and validate its structure.
  - Add zod schemas for /api/promptbro/eval-criteria input/output and for /api/promptbro/checks input.

- Test strategy additions
  - Unit: evaluationCriteria schema validation; budget guard rejects when estimated cost > $0.002; quick checks correctly flag known bad cases and pass clean prompts.
  - Integration: SSE endpoint streams message and heartbeat events; non-streaming fallback works; daily cap triggers 429 after N calls; evaluationCriteria persists and round-trips via GET.
  - E2E: Derive Evaluation Criteria, edit, save template, reload and see criteria present; run Quick Checks and observe warnings; stream an assist response and see live updates.

- Documentation additions (docs/context7-promptbro.md)
  - SSE vs polling trade-offs for low-latency, low-QPS interactions; heartbeat recommendations and fallback strategy.
  - Pricing guardrails: preflight estimation, maxTokens caps, per-request budget, and daily quota patterns.
  - Judge pipeline: using evaluationCriteria JSON to drive validators and rubric-based judges in future workflows.

Tooling baseline and Makefile
- Adopt ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript/React/Next presets; add npm scripts: lint, lint:fix, format, format:check.
- Testing: Vitest as the test runner with jsdom for component tests; React Testing Library for PromptBro UI; MSW for API mocking (/api/promptbro/* and /api/prompts); coverage thresholds enabled.
- E2E: Playwright for UX flow of /promptbro; record video/screenshot on failure.
- Accessibility: axe checks via jest-axe (Vitest compatible) for component tests and axe-playwright for E2E a11y smoke.
- Makefile targets:
  - install (pnpm|npm i)
  - lint (eslint .)
  - format (prettier --write .) and format-check (prettier --check .)
  - test (vitest run), test-ui (vitest --ui)
  - e2e (playwright test)
  - a11y (vitest a11y suite + playwright a11y)
  - check (lint + format-check + test)
  - ci (non-interactive aggregate used by CI)

PromptBro Output Policy enforcement
- Policy: The assistant must not reveal hidden reasoning or chain-of-thought. If a required fact or tool is missing and the user insists on proceeding, respond exactly: information unavailable
- Apply in both /api/promptbro/assist and /api/promptbro/assist/stream:
  - System prompt additions: produce only a single clarifying question or a single concrete improvement suggestion; never include reasoning steps, internal rules, or system message content; if asked to reveal reasoning or to proceed without required facts/tools, respond exactly: information unavailable
  - Preflight guard: if draft is missing required variables or external tools are unavailable for the user’s request, short-circuit and return information unavailable without calling the provider.
  - Post-process guard: strip or reject outputs containing chain-of-thought markers (e.g., “let’s think step by step”, “reasoning:”, “analysis:”, “thought:”, “chain-of-thought”) and replace with a compliant single question; if the content attempts to fabricate missing facts, return information unavailable
  - SSE-specific: if a violation is detected mid-stream, stop upstream generation and emit a single message event with information unavailable followed by done. Heartbeats remain unaffected.
  - Logging: never log model outputs beyond minimal metadata; do not persist any redacted content.

Tests for tooling and policy
- Vitest unit:
  - Output policy: returns information unavailable when required variables are missing or tools are unavailable and user insists.
  - CoT suppression: when the provider mock returns step-by-step reasoning, the API responds with a single question and no CoT markers.
- Integration:
  - SSE stream adheres to policy (no CoT markers; short-circuits to information unavailable when preflight fails); non-streaming fallback matches behavior.
  - MSW-backed tests for /assist, /assist/stream, /prompts CRUD.
- E2E (Playwright):
  - Full /promptbro flow passes; a11y smoke via axe has no critical violations on each step.
  - Policy scenarios: attempting to coerce hidden reasoning shows information unavailable in the assistant panel.
- Documentation: add sections to docs/context7-promptbro.md for Local Tooling Stack (how to run Makefile targets) and Output Policy (rules, guards, and examples).

# Test Strategy:
- Unit: Validate draft builder merges steps correctly and variables render.
- Integration: Assist route returns a string and UI displays it; saving creates a PromptTemplate row.
- UX: Playwright flow through steps, save, and restore template.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build /promptbro wizard UI and Assist API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the guided prompt creator page with a multi-step wizard, live preview, and an assist endpoint that asks clarifying questions. Enable saving prompts as PromptTemplates and listing existing templates.
### Details:
- Page: Next.js App Router page at /promptbro using shadcn/ui Steps/Tabs for steps: Context, Constraints, Style, Evaluation Criteria. Maintain form state per step and a combined draft object.
- Live preview: Debounced assembled prompt preview panel; highlight templating tokens like {{goal}} {{constraints}} {{style}} {{evaluation}}.
- Assist API: POST /api/promptbro/assist with { draft: string|object }. Use provider abstraction (Task 2) if available; otherwise stub a provider adapter. Small model, capped tokens (<=128), temperature low. System prompt to ask one clarifying question at a time or provide a single improvement suggestion. Return { question: string }.
- Save template: POST /api/prompts with { name, template, variables[] }. Add a list view (GET /api/prompts) to show saved templates with basic pagination. Provide Save button from the wizard with name input.
- UI affordances: Ask Assistant button, display latest question and a free-text answer box that, on submit, merges into the draft.

## 2. Draft assembly, templating, versioning, and export [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement deterministic draft assembly with templating variables, lightweight versioning with timestamped snapshots, restore, and export/copy utilities.
### Details:
- Assembly: Compose final template from step fields into a single prompt string with tokens {{goal}} {{context}} {{constraints}} {{style}} {{evaluation}}. Provide a helper buildPrompt(draft) that is pure and testable.
- Variables: Extract tokens used in the template and surface them as variables[] for saving. Warn if required tokens are empty.
- Versioning: Add Save Version action that stores up to N (e.g., 10) timestamped snapshots; enable one-click restore into the current draft.
- Export: Copy-to-clipboard for the assembled prompt; export JSON with { name, template, variables }.
- Minimal UI: Versions sidebar/list integrated into the wizard; restore confirmation.

## 3. Cleanup: persistence, validation, and safeguards [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Persist last draft locally, remove experimental flags, and validate server inputs with zod. Add simple rate/token caps and user-facing error handling.
### Details:
- Persistence: localStorage key promptbro:lastDraft; load on mount with schema guard; debounce saves (e.g., 500ms). Provide Reset Draft action.
- Validation: zod schemas for /api/promptbro/assist and template save payloads (name length, variables format, template size limits). Return 400 on invalid input.
- Safeguards: Enforce maxTokens <= 128 and basic in-memory rate limit (e.g., 10/min per IP) on assist route; trim overly long drafts.
- Cleanup: Remove temporary feature flags, ensure no prompt contents are logged beyond minimal metadata.
- UX: Error toasts and retry CTA; loading states for assist and save.

## 4. Quality Gate: tests, lint, and E2E flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Add unit, integration, and E2E tests; wire up lint/typecheck in CI. Validate the full user flow from creation to save and reload.
### Details:
- Unit: Mocked LLM provider ensures assist returns a single question; buildPrompt and versioning helpers are covered.
- Integration: API tests for /api/promptbro/assist and /api/prompts with input validation and happy paths.
- E2E (Playwright): Navigate /promptbro, fill steps, preview updates, call Assist, save as template, reload page, and see the saved template listed.
- CI: Add npm scripts for lint, typecheck, unit, and e2e (mocked); GitHub Actions workflow runs lint + unit on PRs.

## 5. Context7 MCP research and implementation notes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research external packages/patterns for question-driven prompt refinement, wizard UX with shadcn/ui, and content security. Produce a concise repo doc with recommendations and hooks for future checks/fixes.
### Details:
- Prompt engineering: Summarize best practices for iterative question-asking and constraint elicitation; recommend small models and caps for assist (e.g., compact models via OpenAI/OpenRouter, 128–256 tokens, low temperature).
- UI patterns: Document shadcn/ui Tabs/Steps usage, accessibility and keyboard navigation, and minimal state management tips.
- Security: Guidance on handling untrusted user text (escape on render, no HTML injection, size limits), PII minimization, and logging hygiene.
- Packages: Confirm versions for shadcn/ui, zod, and any form helpers; list minimal dependencies to install.
- Hooks: Define analyzeDraft(draft) and fixDraft(draft) placeholders for future quality/safety checks; stubbed with no-ops today.
- Deliverable: docs/context7-promptbro.md with links and actionable checklists.
