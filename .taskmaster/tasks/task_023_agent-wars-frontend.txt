# Task ID: 23
# Title: Apply 4-Color Design and Layout Spec to Main Landing Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the exact 4-color design and layout specifications for the main landing page of the application.
# Details:
1. Apply the specified color palette using hex values: Dark Slate #3F404C for text and borders, Warm Beige #DFD4CA for secondary backgrounds and accents, Light Cream #ECEADF for the main page background and cards, and Bright Orange #FE6726 for primary links and accents. 2. Set the layout to have a full-viewport Light Cream background with a centered container that has a maximum width of 1280px and 24px horizontal padding. Use a CSS grid with 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))' and a 24px gap. 3. Implement the typography system using the specified system stack and hierarchy. 4. Design cards with a white background, rounded corners, shadows, padding, and borders as specified. 5. Create buttons with the defined styles for primary and secondary actions. 6. Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet views as specified. 7. Ensure interactive states are applied correctly for hover, focus, and active states. 8. Conduct accessibility checks for contrast and focus visibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the landing page matches the design specifications exactly, including colors, sizes, spacing, and interactive states. 2. Conduct accessibility tests to ensure compliance with contrast and focus visibility standards. 3. Perform end-to-end testing to confirm that all elements function as expected and that no other pages are affected by these changes. 4. Use visual regression testing to ensure that the layout remains consistent across different devices and screen sizes.
