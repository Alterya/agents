# Task ID: 14
# Title: Enable and Support Design System Rollout Across the App
# Status: review
# Dependencies: 1, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement backend support for the design system rollout, including theme configuration, hero content delivery, asset optimization, and performance enhancements.
# Details:
1. Expose theme/config options through environment variables or API routes to allow frontend toggling of accent color, typography, and animation settings. 2. Ensure API routes provide necessary content and metadata for hero sections, including titles, subtitles, and CTA targets, along with SEO/open-graph metadata utilities. 3. Optimize the asset pipeline for image handling, CDN paths, icons, and static assets to align with the new design system. 4. Implement caching headers for API responses used in layout-level rendering to enhance performance. 5. Update existing tests and add basic logging for theme/config endpoints to ensure observability and reliability.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the theme/config options are accessible and correctly toggleable from the frontend. 2. Test API routes to ensure they return the correct hero content and metadata, including SEO/open-graph data. 3. Validate that images are optimized and served correctly from the CDN. 4. Check caching headers on API responses to confirm they are set appropriately. 5. Run updated tests to ensure all theme/config endpoints function as expected and log relevant information correctly.
