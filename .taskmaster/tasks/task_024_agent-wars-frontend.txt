# Title: Implement Prompt Wars Page Design Spec
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Prompt Wars page according to the provided design specifications, ensuring all elements are styled and functional as per the requirements.
# Details:
1. Create an outer container with a white background, 12px border radius, 1px #DFD4CA border, and subtle shadow. Implement a 12-column grid layout with a 24px gap for desktop and a single column for mobile. 2. Add a header with a title styled at 20px/600 weight in #3F404C and a subtitle at 14px with 70% opacity. 3. Implement a comparison mode toggle with specified colors and dimensions, ensuring smooth transitions. 4. Design prompt/model pairs as white cards with specific styling, including a header bar and action buttons. 5. Create form elements with defined styles for labels, selects, and textareas, ensuring focus states are implemented. 6. Set up a model selection grid with hover effects and selected states. 7. Add action buttons with specified styles and interactions. 8. Implement the opposing side configuration with radio buttons and labels. 9. Create a default scammer section with specified styles. 10. Ensure proper spacing between sections and interactive states for all elements. 11. Implement animations for transitions and interactive elements as specified.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the page matches the design specifications exactly, including all styles, layouts, and responsive behaviors. 2. Conduct user testing to ensure all interactive elements function as expected, including the toggle and buttons. 3. Perform accessibility checks to ensure compliance with standards. 4. Use Playwright to run end-to-end tests to confirm that all elements are rendered correctly and that interactions work as intended.
