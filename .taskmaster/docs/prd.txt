# Daily Alert Summary Agent - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Create an automated agent that triggers daily at 10 AM Jerusalem time to retrieve all Grafana alerts from the previous 24 hours, intelligently group them using OpenRouter with Claude 4 Sonnet, and deliver a comprehensive summary to the team via Slack.

### Primary Goal
Summarize the day-before alerts to improve team awareness and reduce time spent manually reviewing alert data, enhancing overall incident response and system health visibility.

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Development/Operations Team
- **As a team member**, I want to receive a daily digest of yesterday's alerts so I can quickly understand what happened in our systems without manually checking multiple dashboards.
- **As a team lead**, I want alerts grouped logically (by service, severity, frequency) so I can prioritize follow-up actions and identify patterns.
- **As an on-call engineer**, I want to see alert trends and resolutions so I can better prepare for potential recurring issues.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Scheduling**: Local cron-based scheduling system triggering at 10:00 AM Jerusalem time (UTC+2/UTC+3 depending on DST)
2. **Data Collection**: Integrate with Grafana MCP to fetch all alerts from the previous 24-hour period
3. **AI-Powered Grouping**: Use OpenRouter with Claude 4 Sonnet for intelligent alert grouping by:
   - Service/component
   - Severity level
   - Alert frequency/patterns
   - Resolution status
4. **Summary Generation**: Create human-readable summaries with actionable insights using Claude 4 Sonnet
5. **Delivery**: Send formatted summaries to designated Slack channel/group

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **AI Provider**: OpenRouter with Claude 4 Sonnet model
- **Scheduling**: Python cron (APScheduler) with Jerusalem timezone support
- **Environment Management**: Python virtual environment with requirements.txt
- **Configuration**: Python-dotenv for environment variables and YAML configuration
- **HTTP Client**: httpx for async requests to Grafana and Slack APIs

### Technical Constraints
- Use local Python scheduling system (APScheduler)
- Leverage existing mcp.json configuration for Grafana setup inspiration
- No specific Slack workspace/channel requirements (flexible configuration)
- Custom AI prompt-driven alert grouping logic using Claude 4 Sonnet via OpenRouter

### Integration Points
- **Grafana MCP**: Primary data source for alert information
- **OpenRouter API**: AI service provider for Claude 4 Sonnet access
- **Slack API**: Delivery mechanism for summaries
- **Local Python Scheduler**: Scheduling and automation

## Functional Requirements

### Alert Data Processing
1. Retrieve alerts from last 24 hours via Grafana MCP
2. Parse and structure alert data (timestamp, severity, service, description, status)
3. Apply AI-powered grouping using Claude 4 Sonnet via OpenRouter
4. Generate summary statistics and trend analysis

### AI-Powered Summary Generation
1. Use Claude 4 Sonnet to create executive summary with key metrics
2. Provide AI-generated detailed breakdowns by service/severity
3. Highlight critical alerts requiring attention using AI analysis
4. Include resolution status and timing information
5. Format content for optimal Slack readability

### Delivery System
1. Format summaries for Slack channel consumption
2. Include appropriate formatting (markdown, mentions, threads)
3. Handle delivery failures gracefully with retry logic
4. Provide configuration options for channel selection

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- Ensure daily execution consistency with Python cron
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Provide logging for troubleshooting

### Performance
- Complete processing within reasonable time limits (< 5 minutes)
- Handle large volumes of alert data efficiently
- Minimize API calls to external services
- Optimize OpenRouter API usage for cost efficiency

### Maintainability
- Modular Python code structure for easy updates
- Configurable parameters via environment variables and YAML
- Clear documentation and setup instructions
- Virtual environment for dependency isolation

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Automation Success**: 100% reliable daily execution at scheduled time
2. **Data Accuracy**: Complete and accurate alert data retrieval from Grafana
3. **AI Quality**: High-quality, contextual grouping and summaries from Claude 4 Sonnet
4. **Team Adoption**: Regular team consumption of daily summaries
5. **Time Savings**: Reduced manual alert review time for team members

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Alert Pattern Recognition**: AI-powered identification of recurring issues through intelligent grouping
2. **Actionable Insights**: Summaries that lead to proactive system improvements
3. **Slack Integration**: Seamless delivery and formatting in team channels
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized OpenRouter API usage

## Out of Scope (Initial Version)
- Interactive alert management capabilities
- Historical trend analysis beyond 24 hours
- Integration with monitoring tools other than Grafana
- Advanced ML-based alert correlation beyond Claude 4 Sonnet capabilities
- Real-time alert notifications (this is for daily summaries only)
- Custom dashboard creation
- Alert escalation workflows
- Complex deployment infrastructure (CI/CD, containers, Kubernetes)
- Comprehensive testing frameworks
- Performance optimization beyond basic requirements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Python Agent Development
- Python project setup with virtual environment
- Basic Grafana MCP integration using httpx
- Alert data retrieval and parsing
- Local Python scheduling setup with APScheduler

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Processing with OpenRouter

- Summary generation using Claude 4 Sonnet
- Data formatting and structuring

### Phase 3: Slack Integration & Orchestration
- Slack API integration with httpx
- Message formatting and delivery
- Error handling and retry logic
- Main orchestrator script

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Scheduler**: APScheduler-based daily trigger
2. **Data Collector**: Grafana MCP integration module using httpx
3. **AI Processor**: OpenRouter + Claude 4 Sonnet integration for grouping and analysis
4. **Generator**: AI-powered summary creation and formatting
5. **Notifier**: Slack delivery system
6. **Configuration**: Environment and YAML configuration management

### Data Flow
1. APScheduler triggers agent at 10 AM Jerusalem time
2. Agent connects to Grafana via MCP using httpx
