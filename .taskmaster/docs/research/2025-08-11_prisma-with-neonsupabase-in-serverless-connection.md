# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Prisma with Neon/Supabase in serverless: connection pooling, DIRECT_URL vs pooled DATABASE_URL, Accelerate/Data Proxy guidance (2025).

**Response:**

Below is a 2025-ready, serverless-focused playbook for using Prisma with Neon or Supabase. It covers connection pooling, how to use DATABASE_URL vs DIRECT_URL correctly, and when to pick Prisma Accelerate vs database-side pooling (and what to do about the old Data Proxy). At the end you’ll find concrete, project-specific recommendations for your current tasks (schema, Hub/Scale pages, tests), with sample code and env setups for both Neon and Supabase.

Executive summary (what to choose)
- Node.js serverless (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, etc.):
  - Default: Use database-level pooling (Neon or Supabase PgBouncer) for DATABASE_URL; set DIRECT_URL to the non-pooled writer for migrations and Prisma Studio.
  - If you expect very high concurrency or want global edge/HTTP access: Use Prisma Accelerate (HTTP) for DATABASE_URL, keep DIRECT_URL pointing to the direct writer. Do not use the legacy Data Proxy.
- Next.js Edge Runtime or Workers (no TCP): Use Prisma Accelerate with @prisma/client/edge. Alternatively, Prisma driver adapters with a Postgres HTTP driver exist but are still a more advanced path; Accelerate is the simplest, well-supported choice.
- Local dev and CI migrations: Always use DIRECT_URL (non-pooled writer) for migrate/studio/introspection. Prisma CLI will automatically prefer DIRECT_URL when present.

1) Background: why pooling and why DIRECT_URL exists
- Serverless functions spin up many short-lived instances. If each instance opens its own database connection, you can quickly exhaust Postgres limits and see timeouts.
- Neon and Supabase provide PgBouncer transaction pooling endpoints. Prisma can work with these poolers, but you must tell Prisma to disable prepared statements by using pgbouncer=true. You should also limit per-function connection count (connection_limit=1) to avoid storms.
- Prisma’s DIRECT_URL is used by CLI tooling (migrate, introspect, studio) and intentionally bypasses your pooled/proxied DATABASE_URL. This is important because:
  - Migrations and schema ops use multi-statement transactions and advisory locks that can be problematic behind PgBouncer transaction mode.
  - DIRECT_URL ensures strong, direct access to the primary (writer) instance with predictable semantics.
- With Prisma Accelerate (Prisma’s HTTP proxy/pool/cache), DATABASE_URL points to the Accelerate URL; DIRECT_URL still points directly to the database for migrations and studio.

2) Prisma Accelerate vs database-side pooling vs the old Data Proxy
- Database-side pooling (PgBouncer):
  - Pros: No extra vendor component, often free/included, simple to reason about, works well in Node serverless.
  - Cons: Prepared statements disabled; transaction mode limits features like LISTEN/NOTIFY and session state. Still vulnerable to connection storms during big spikes if misconfigured.
- Prisma Accelerate:
  - Pros: HTTP-based, great for Edge runtimes and high concurrency; reduces cold-start/connections; optional query caching; globally distributed. Smoothest path for “serverless at scale.”
  - Cons: Another hosted component; some features are paid beyond the free tier; requires small code changes ($extends(withAccelerate())).
- Data Proxy (older):
  - As of 2025, Prisma guidance is to use Accelerate. Data Proxy has been effectively superseded. If you see older prisma:// URLs, treat them as Accelerate now and follow Accelerate docs. New projects should not target the legacy Data Proxy product.

3) Connection strings that work (Neon and Supabase)
Neon (pooled + direct)
- DATABASE_URL (pooled, used by Prisma Client at runtime):
  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX-pooler.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&connect_timeout=5
- DIRECT_URL (direct writer, used by CLI: migrate/studio):
  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require
Notes:
- Use the pooler host for DATABASE_URL and the primary (non-pooler) writer host for DIRECT_URL.
- pgbouncer=true disables prepared statements; connection_limit=1 avoids per-instance storms.
- Always include sslmode=require in hosted environments.

Supabase (pooled + direct)
- DATABASE_URL (pooled):
  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db-pooler.supabase.co:6543/postgres?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1
- DIRECT_URL (direct writer):
  postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
Notes:
- Grab the pooled and direct connection strings from Supabase > Project Settings > Database > Connection pooling.
- Keep the same flags as Neon for serverless stability.

Prisma Accelerate
- DATABASE_URL (Accelerate):
  prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=YOUR_ACCELERATE_API_KEY
- DIRECT_URL:
  Use the same direct writer as above (Neon or Supabase), with sslmode=require and without pgbouncer.

4) Schema and Prisma configuration (DATABASE_URL vs DIRECT_URL)
In prisma/schema.prisma:
- datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")   // pooled or Accelerate
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")     // direct writer for migrate/studio
  }
- generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }
Key points:
- The Prisma Client (runtime queries in your app) uses url (DATABASE_URL).
- Prisma CLI (migrate, studio, introspect) prefers directUrl (DIRECT_URL) automatically when present.
- This split is critical for serverless stability and reliable migrations.

5) Prisma Client instantiation (Node serverless vs Edge)
Node (default for API routes and server actions that talk to the DB):
- Without Accelerate (using Neon/Supabase pooling):
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

  const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma?: PrismaClient };

  export const prisma =
    globalForPrisma.prisma ??
    new PrismaClient({
      log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
    });

  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

- With Accelerate (Node):
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
  import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate';

  const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma?: PrismaClient & { /* extended */ } };

  const base = new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
  }).$extends(withAccelerate());

  export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? base;
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

Edge (if you truly need Edge and DB access):
- Requires Accelerate:
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge';
  import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate';

  export const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());
Notes:
- Edge runtimes cannot create raw TCP connections; Accelerate provides an HTTP transport.
- If you don’t need Edge, prefer Node runtime for DB work; keep Edge for pure compute/streaming that doesn’t touch Postgres.

6) Operational flags and timeouts that matter
- pgbouncer=true (critical with transaction pooling): disables prepared statements so queries don’t fail when a pooled connection is swapped under you.
- connection_limit=1: keep per-instance connections minimal; serverless platforms can scale concurrency for you.
- connect_timeout=5 and/or statement_timeout=5000: add timeouts to fail fast in spiky scenarios. You can pass statement_timeout in the connection string (e.g., &statement_timeout=5000) to limit long-running queries. For this project, queries are short; set a modest timeout to surface issues quickly.
- pool timeout: Prisma supports a pool timeout via connection string parameter pool_timeout (seconds) if you stick to TCP (pg). If you push extremely high concurrency, consider Accelerate to avoid tuning at this level.
- SSL: Always include sslmode=require in hosted environments.

7) How this applies to your current tasks
Task 1 (DB schema/models + migrations + seed + repo utilities)
- Use Prisma v5 with Postgres and adopt pooled DATABASE_URL + direct DIRECT_URL as shown above.
- Recommended default stack: Neon or Supabase with PgBouncer for DATABASE_URL; direct writer for DIRECT_URL.
- prisma/schema.prisma:
  datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")   // pooled or Accelerate
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")     // direct primary/writer (non-pooled)
  }

  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }

- .env examples (Neon):
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX-pooler.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&connect_timeout=5"
  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require"

- .env examples (Supabase):
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db-pooler.supabase.co:6543/postgres?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@db.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"

- Seeding: run via Node process (prisma db seed) which will use DIRECT_URL (via CLI) for reliable startup. Avoid seeding through serverless routes.
- Repository utilities: instantiate Prisma using the Node singleton pattern shown above. Do not create a new PrismaClient per request.

Task 5 (Agent Wars Hub), Task 6 (Scale Testing), Task 7 (PromptBro)
- Keep DB-touching API routes on Node runtime by default. Put streaming-only LLM logic on Edge if desired, but move DB writes to Node handlers or use Accelerate to allow Edge writes.
- High-concurrency endpoints (e.g., running multiple background conversations):
  - If concurrency grows, either raise connection_limit carefully (e.g., to 2–3) or flip to Accelerate. Accelerate will better tolerate spikes and cold starts without connection churn.
  - Avoid long transactions; keep each DB operation short and idempotent; use upserts where possible for progress updates.
- Read-heavy polling (Hub/Scale progress, messages):
  - If you enable Accelerate later, you can explore read caching for “list messages” or “list sessions” endpoints with short TTLs. Start uncached to keep consistency simple.

Testing strategy (from your Task 1 test plan)
- For local unit/integration tests:
  - Option A: Use Docker Postgres and a local non-pooled URL for both DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL. This is the simplest and fastest for CI.
  - Option B: Use a Neon branch database. For CI speed and reliability, still prefer the direct (non-pooled) branch URL for tests. The pgbouncer path isn’t needed for unit tests; if you want to mimic production, run a small subset against the pooled URL to validate.
- Apply migrations with prisma migrate using DIRECT_URL; run CRUD tests; verify indexes with EXPLAIN.

8) Pitfalls and edge cases (and how to avoid them)
- Prepared statements with PgBouncer: If you forget pgbouncer=true, you’ll hit “prepared statement does not exist” or similar errors under load. Always include it on pooled DATABASE_URL.
- Transactions + PgBouncer: Don’t use session-required features (e.g., LISTEN/NOTIFY, temp tables, session variables) in routes behind transaction pooling. Prisma migrations and studio are kept safe via DIRECT_URL.
- Connection storms: If you see spikes, audit that you aren’t instantiating Prisma per request. Enforce a singleton. For sustained spikes, consider Accelerate.
- Edge runtime accidentally hitting the DB: Next.js defaults to Node for API routes unless set to edge. Be explicit with runtime if needed. If you must write from Edge, switch to Accelerate and use @prisma/client/edge.
- Long-running operations: For LLM runs, do not hold open DB transactions across the entire stream. Write small, discrete updates to keep connection time minimal. Consider a job table and periodic writes rather than chatty per-token writes.
- Migrations in production: Run them from CI or a controlled runner that uses DIRECT_URL. Avoid running through pooled endpoints. If your vendor enforces strict IP controls, run migrations from a place/IP they allow.

9) Optional: Prisma driver adapters for Postgres HTTP drivers
- Prisma has “driver adapters” that let Prisma Client talk over non-default drivers (e.g., HTTP drivers like Neon serverless). As of 2025, these are available but remain a more advanced setup compared to Accelerate for serverless/edge. Unless you have a specific reason (e.g., keep everything in Edge without Accelerate), prefer database pooling or Accelerate.
- If you later test driver adapters, do so behind feature flags and do not block mainline development. The current project needs predictable stability more than experimental setups.

10) Concrete “pick-one” recipes you can copy into this repo
Recipe A: Neon + PgBouncer (recommended default)
- .env
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX-pooler.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&connect_timeout=5"
  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require"

- prisma/schema.prisma
  datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
  }

  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }

- lib/db.ts
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

  const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma?: PrismaClient };

  export const prisma =
    globalForPrisma.prisma ??
    new PrismaClient({
      log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
    });

  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

Recipe B: Prisma Accelerate (Node or Edge; flip when you need scale or Edge DB access)
- .env
  DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=YOUR_ACCELERATE_API_KEY"
  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXX.REGION.aws.neon.tech/DB_NAME?sslmode=require"  // or Supabase direct writer

- prisma/schema.prisma
  datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")   // Accelerate URL
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")     // direct writer
  }

  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }

- Node runtime client (lib/db.ts):
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
  import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate';

  const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma?: any };

  const prismaBase = new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
  }).$extends(withAccelerate());

  export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? prismaBase;
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

- Edge runtime client (only for Edge routes):
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge';
  import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate';
  export const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

11) Applying this to your API design in Tasks 5 and 6
- Hub (/hub) and Scale (/scale) pages will poll progress and read messages frequently:
  - Reads are safe behind pooling; keep queries simple with appropriate indexes (e.g., message conversationId, createdAt).
  - For very chatty polling, consider exponential backoff on the frontend and avoid re-querying unchanged windows (e.g., use “since last message id”).
- Writes during long LLM runs:
  - Write once per assistant/user message, not per token; limit open connection time by batching.
  - Consider a job table with heartbeat timestamps so the UI can poll status without constant heavy reads.
- If you later enable Accelerate caching:
  - Start with no caching for write-heavy tables (Message, Conversation).
  - Optionally enable short TTL caching for relatively static reads (Agents list) to reduce read load.
  - Validate cache consistency on writes before enabling for chat-related reads.

12) Security and observability
- Rotate DB credentials and Accelerate API keys regularly; store in your platform’s secret manager.
- Set sslmode=require (Neon/Supabase) always.
- Enable slow query logging during development; use EXPLAIN on frequent reads (message pagination) and add indexes accordingly.
- Monitor connection counts:
  - Neon/Supabase dashboards show active connections. If you see spikes/caps, confirm singleton Prisma usage and connection_limit=1.
  - With Accelerate, monitor the proxy metrics and cache hit rates (if enabled).

Bottom line for this repo
- Start with database-side pooling and DIRECT_URL for migrate/studio. This is the simplest, low-cost, stable baseline for Tasks 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- Keep the code structured so you can flip to Accelerate by only:
  - Changing DATABASE_URL to the Accelerate URL,
  - Adding $extends(withAccelerate()),
  - Optionally using @prisma/client/edge on any Edge routes.
- Do not use the legacy Data Proxy directly. If you encounter old references, treat them as an Accelerate migration target.
- For tests and migrations, rely on DIRECT_URL (non-pooled writer) to avoid PgBouncer transaction-mode constraints.

If you want, I can provide a ready-to-commit PR diff for:
- prisma/schema.prisma with datasource and generator configured,
- lib/db.ts with Node singleton and optional Accelerate variant,
- .env.example for Neon and Supabase (pooled + direct),
- Minimal seed script template that uses prisma db seed safely with DIRECT_URL.
