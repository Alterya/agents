# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** UI progress patterns in Next.js for batch jobs: polling vs SSE vs WebSockets on Vercel. Consider bundle impact and client a11y. Provide minimal patterns for rendering progress, throttling/backoff, and accessibility guidance.

**Response:**

## UI Progress Patterns in Next.js for Batch Jobs

When developing a user interface for batch jobs in a Next.js application, particularly in the context of your project involving concurrent battles between LLM models, it is crucial to choose the right method for real-time progress updates. The three primary techniques for achieving this are **polling**, **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**, and **WebSockets**. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, especially when considering deployment on Vercel, bundle size impact, and accessibility (a11y) for users.

### 1. Polling

**Overview**: Polling involves making repeated requests to the server at regular intervals to check for updates. In your project, this could mean calling the `/api/battles/:jobId/status` endpoint every 1-2 seconds.

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Polling is straightforward to implement and understand. It requires no special server configuration beyond standard HTTP endpoints.
- **Compatibility**: Works well with existing HTTP infrastructure and is compatible with all browsers.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Inefficiency**: Polling can lead to unnecessary network traffic and server load, especially if the job status does not change frequently.
- **Latency**: There is an inherent delay in receiving updates, which can be problematic for real-time applications.

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/battles/${jobId}/status`);
    const data = await res.json();
    setJob(data);
  }, 2000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [jobId]);
```

### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Overview**: SSE allows the server to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. This is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates without the overhead of establishing a new connection for each message.

**Advantages**:
- **Efficiency**: SSE maintains a single connection, reducing overhead and allowing for real-time updates.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: If the connection drops, the browser automatically attempts to reconnect.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Browser Support**: While most modern browsers support SSE, older browsers may not.
- **Limited to One-Way Communication**: SSE only allows the server to send data to the client, which may not be suitable for all applications.

**Implementation Example**:
In your `ScaleRunner.tsx`, you already have a basic implementation of SSE:
```javascript
const es = new EventSource(`/api/scale/${json.id}/status`);
es.onmessage = (ev) => {
  const j = JSON.parse(ev.data);
  setJob(j);
};
```

### 3. WebSockets

**Overview**: WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This allows for real-time, two-way communication between the client and server.

**Advantages**:
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets are ideal for applications that require instant updates and two-way communication.
- **Reduced Latency**: Once the connection is established, messages can be sent and received with minimal delay.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Complexity**: Implementing WebSockets can be more complex than polling or SSE, requiring additional server-side logic.
- **Resource Intensive**: Maintaining many open WebSocket connections can consume more server resources.

**Implementation Example**:
If you decide to implement WebSockets, you would typically set up a WebSocket server and connect to it from your client:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://yourserver.com/socket');
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  setJob(data);
};
```

### 4. Bundle Impact and Performance Considerations

When deploying on Vercel, it is essential to consider the impact of your chosen method on the bundle size and overall performance. Polling is the least resource-intensive in terms of client-side code, while SSE and WebSockets may require additional libraries or polyfills, increasing the bundle size.

- **Polling**: Minimal impact on bundle size, but can lead to performance issues due to frequent requests.
- **SSE**: Slightly larger bundle size due to the need for handling event streams, but generally efficient for real-time updates.
- **WebSockets**: May require additional libraries (e.g., `socket.io`), which can significantly increase the bundle size.

### 5. Accessibility (a11y) Guidance

Regardless of the method chosen, ensuring that your UI is accessible is paramount. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- **Live Regions**: Use ARIA live regions to announce updates to users. For example, when the job status changes, you can update a live region to inform screen reader users.
```html
<span aria-live="polite" className="status-update">
  {job ? `Status: ${job.status}` : submitting ? "pendingâ€¦" : ""}
</span>
```

- **Focus Management**: Ensure that focus is managed appropriately when updates occur. For instance, if a new message is added to the chat, focus should be set to that message.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation, and provide clear visual indicators for focus states.

### 6. Rendering Progress and Throttling/Backoff

When rendering progress, consider using a combination of spinners and progress bars to visually indicate the status of the batch job. For example, you could implement a progress bar that fills based on the job's completion percentage.

**Throttling and Backoff**: If using polling, implement a backoff strategy to reduce the frequency of requests when the job is not progressing. For example, you could start with a 1-second interval and double it up to a maximum of 10 seconds if no updates are received.

### 7. Conclusion

In summary, the choice between polling, SSE, and WebSockets for real-time updates in your Next.js application depends on your specific requirements for performance, complexity, and accessibility. Given the context of your project, SSE may provide a good balance between simplicity and real-time capabilities, especially for the concurrent battles feature. However, if you anticipate needing two-way communication in the future, consider implementing WebSockets.

By following the outlined strategies for rendering progress, managing accessibility, and considering the impact on bundle size, you can create a robust and user-friendly interface for your batch job management system.
