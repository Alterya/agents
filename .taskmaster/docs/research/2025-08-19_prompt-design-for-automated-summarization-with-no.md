# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Prompt design for automated summarization with no chain-of-thought: enforce strict JSON schema, short rationale (<=100 words), and graceful 'information unavailable'. Provide robust system prompts and parsing tips to avoid leaking reasoning. Cite recent best practices.

**Response:**

## Introduction

Designing prompts for automated summarization requires a careful balance between clarity, structure, and the constraints of the underlying model. In the context of your project, particularly with the `summarizer.ts` file, the goal is to enforce a strict JSON schema while ensuring that the rationale remains concise and devoid of any reasoning or chain-of-thought. This response will outline best practices for prompt design, provide robust system prompts, and offer parsing tips to avoid leaking reasoning, all tailored to your project's needs.

## Understanding the JSON Schema

The JSON schema you are enforcing consists of three keys: `summary`, `revisedPrompt`, and `rationale`. Each of these keys serves a specific purpose:

1. **Summary**: This should encapsulate the main points of the conversations succinctly.
2. **RevisedPrompt**: This key is intended to capture any improvements or modifications to the original prompt based on the analysis of the conversations.
3. **Rationale**: This is a brief explanation (<=100 words) of why the summary and revised prompt were generated, which must be concise and free from reasoning.

### Example of a Valid JSON Output

```json
{
  "summary": "The conversations focused on user engagement strategies, highlighting the importance of personalized content.",
  "revisedPrompt": "How can we enhance user engagement through personalized content?",
  "rationale": "The summary reflects the main themes discussed, while the revised prompt aims to refine the focus on personalization."
}
```

## Crafting the System Prompt

The system prompt is crucial as it sets the tone and constraints for the model's output. Hereâ€™s a refined version of your existing system prompt, incorporating best practices:

```plaintext
You are PromptBro Analyst. Given multiple conversations with outcomes and failure cases, produce STRICT JSON with the following keys: 
- summary (string): A concise summary of the conversations.
- revisedPrompt (string): An improved version of the original prompt.
- rationale (string): A brief explanation (<=100 words) of the summary and revised prompt. 

Ensure that the rationale is concise and does not include any reasoning or chain-of-thought. If any required fact is missing, set the field value to "information unavailable".
```

### Key Considerations for the System Prompt

1. **Clarity**: The instructions should be clear and unambiguous to avoid misinterpretation by the model.
2. **Strictness**: Emphasizing the need for strict adherence to the JSON format helps prevent errors in output.
3. **Conciseness**: The rationale should be limited to 100 words, which encourages brevity and focus.

## Handling Missing Information

In scenarios where information is unavailable, it is essential to handle this gracefully. The system prompt already includes instructions to set the field value to "information unavailable". However, you should also consider implementing checks in your code to ensure that the model does not attempt to infer or fabricate missing information.

### Example Code Snippet for Handling Missing Information

```typescript
if (!parsed.summary || !parsed.revisedPrompt || !parsed.rationale) {
  parsed = {
    summary: parsed.summary || "information unavailable",
    revisedPrompt: parsed.revisedPrompt || "information unavailable",
    rationale: parsed.rationale || "information unavailable"
  };
}
```

## Parsing Tips to Avoid Leaking Reasoning

To ensure that the output does not leak reasoning or chain-of-thought, consider the following strategies:

1. **Output Validation**: After receiving the model's output, validate that the `rationale` does not exceed 100 words and does not contain any reasoning. This can be done using regular expressions or simple string checks.

2. **Structured Output**: Encourage the model to produce structured outputs by explicitly stating the format in the prompt. This reduces the likelihood of verbose or reasoning-laden responses.

3. **Post-Processing**: Implement a post-processing step that scans the `rationale` for any phrases that indicate reasoning (e.g., "because", "therefore", "this means") and removes or replaces them.

### Example of Post-Processing Logic

```typescript
const reasoningIndicators = ["because", "therefore", "this means"];
const containsReasoning = reasoningIndicators.some(indicator => parsed.rationale.includes(indicator));

if (containsReasoning) {
  parsed.rationale = "information unavailable"; // or provide a generic rationale
}
```

## Recent Best Practices in Prompt Design

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine prompts based on feedback and performance. Analyze the outputs and adjust the system prompt as necessary to improve clarity and adherence to the JSON schema.

2. **User-Centric Design**: In the context of your guided prompt creator, consider how users interact with the system. Provide examples of expected outputs to guide users in crafting their prompts effectively.

3. **Testing and Validation**: Implement robust testing strategies to validate that the outputs conform to the expected JSON schema. This includes unit tests for the `summarizeRuns` function and integration tests for the overall prompt creation flow.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines and best practices, you can create a robust system for automated summarization that meets the strict JSON schema requirements while providing concise and relevant outputs. The strategies outlined here will help ensure that the model's responses are clear, structured, and free from reasoning, aligning with the goals of your project. Implementing these practices will not only enhance the functionality of the summarization feature but also improve the overall user experience in the guided prompt creation process.
