# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Pricing best practices for OpenAI and OpenRouter models in production: dynamic price lookup, conservative estimation, caching with TTL, handling model aliases, and tracking actual usage to reconcile estimates. Provide API references and code sketch.

**Response:**

## Pricing Best Practices for OpenAI and OpenRouter Models in Production

When deploying AI models such as those from OpenAI and OpenRouter in a production environment, it is crucial to implement effective pricing strategies. This ensures that costs are managed efficiently while providing accurate estimates for users. Below, we will explore several best practices, including dynamic price lookup, conservative estimation, caching with TTL, handling model aliases, and tracking actual usage to reconcile estimates. Each section will provide actionable insights relevant to your project context.

### 1. Dynamic Price Lookup

Dynamic price lookup involves fetching the latest pricing information from the API or a pricing service. This is essential because pricing can change based on various factors, including demand, model updates, or promotional offers. 

**Implementation Steps:**
- **API Integration:** Create an API endpoint that retrieves the latest pricing information from OpenAI and OpenRouter. This can be done using a simple GET request.
  
  ```javascript
  async function fetchPricing(provider) {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.${provider}.com/pricing`);
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch pricing');
      return await response.json();
  }
  ```

- **Usage in Cost Estimation:** Modify the `estimateCostUsd` function in your `runners.ts` file to use the dynamic pricing data instead of hardcoded values. This ensures that your cost estimates are always up-to-date.

  ```javascript
  async function estimateCostUsd(model, usage) {
      const pricing = await fetchPricing('openai'); // or 'openrouter'
      const inT = usage?.inputTokens ?? 0;
      const outT = usage?.outputTokens ?? 0;
      return {
          usdIn: (inT / 1000) * pricing.inputCost,
          usdOut: (outT / 1000) * pricing.outputCost,
      };
  }
  ```

### 2. Conservative Estimation

When estimating costs, it is prudent to adopt a conservative approach. This means overestimating the potential usage to avoid unexpected charges. 

**Implementation Steps:**
- **Increase Token Estimates:** Consider adding a buffer to the token estimates. For example, if you expect 1000 input tokens, estimate for 1200 tokens instead.

  ```javascript
  const conservativeEstimate = (tokens) => Math.ceil(tokens * 1.2);
  ```

- **Adjust Cost Calculation:** Use the conservative estimates in your cost calculations to ensure that users are aware of potential maximum costs.

  ```javascript
  const usdIn = estimateCostUsd(conservativeEstimate(inT), conservativeEstimate(outT));
  ```

### 3. Caching with TTL

Caching pricing data can significantly reduce the number of API calls and improve performance. Implementing a Time-To-Live (TTL) mechanism ensures that the cached data is refreshed periodically.

**Implementation Steps:**
- **Implement Caching Logic:** Use a simple in-memory cache or a more robust solution like Redis. Set a TTL for the cached pricing data.

  ```javascript
  const pricingCache = {};
  const CACHE_TTL = 3600 * 1000; // 1 hour

  async function getCachedPricing(provider) {
      const now = Date.now();
      if (pricingCache[provider] && (now - pricingCache[provider].timestamp < CACHE_TTL)) {
          return pricingCache[provider].data;
      }
      const data = await fetchPricing(provider);
      pricingCache[provider] = { data, timestamp: now };
      return data;
  }
  ```

### 4. Handling Model Aliases

Different models may have aliases or different names across providers. It is essential to standardize these names to avoid confusion and ensure accurate pricing.

**Implementation Steps:**
- **Create a Mapping:** Maintain a mapping of model aliases to their standard names.

  ```javascript
  const modelAliases = {
      'gpt-3.5-turbo': 'gpt-3.5',
      'davinci': 'davinci-002',
      // Add more mappings as needed
  };

  function getStandardModelName(model) {
      return modelAliases[model] || model;
  }
  ```

- **Use Standard Names in API Calls:** Ensure that all API calls use the standardized model names.

### 5. Tracking Actual Usage to Reconcile Estimates

To ensure that your cost estimates align with actual usage, implement a tracking mechanism that logs the usage of tokens and costs incurred.

**Implementation Steps:**
- **Log Usage:** Modify the `runBattle` function to log actual usage after each API call.

  ```javascript
  await appendMessage(convo.id, {
      role: "assistant",
      content: text,
      tokensIn: usage?.inputTokens,
      tokensOut: usage?.outputTokens,
      costUsd: turnCost,
  });
  ```

- **Reconcile Estimates:** At the end of a session or periodically, compare the estimated costs with the actual costs logged. This can help identify discrepancies and refine your estimation logic.

### 6. API References and Code Sketch

For the implementation of the above strategies, you may need to refer to the following APIs:

- **OpenAI Pricing API:** [OpenAI Pricing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/pricing)
- **OpenRouter API Documentation:** Check the respective documentation for pricing details.

### Example Code Sketch

Here’s a consolidated code sketch that incorporates the discussed practices:

```javascript
import { chat, type ChatMessage } from "@/lib/llm/provider";
import { createConversation, appendMessage, completeConversation } from "@/repo/conversations";
import { getCachedPricing } from "@/lib/pricing"; // Assume this is implemented as discussed

async function runBattle(input) {
    const pricing = await getCachedPricing(input.provider);
    const acc = { usdIn: 0, usdOut: 0, inputTokens: 0, outputTokens: 0 };
    const messages = [];

    // ... existing logic ...

    const usage = res.usage;
    const { usdIn, usdOut } = estimateCostUsd(getStandardModelName(input.model), usage);
    acc.usdIn += usdIn;
    acc.usdOut += usdOut;

    // ... existing logic ...
}
```

### Conclusion

Implementing these pricing best practices will enhance your application’s efficiency and user experience. By dynamically fetching pricing, conservatively estimating costs, caching data, handling model aliases, and tracking actual usage, you can ensure that your application remains cost-effective and transparent for users. Each of these strategies can be integrated into your existing codebase, particularly within the `runners.ts` file, to improve the overall functionality of your AI model interactions.
